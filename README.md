# Social-Network-Analytics - 2019

Include projects related to below topics with Rï¼š
I.	 Conceptualizing and Measuring Properties of Individuals, Groups, and Networks
II.	 Applications of Networks in Market Settings: Search, Diffusion, Exchange, and Competition
III. Applications of Networks as a Manager and Analyst: Descriptive and Predictive Approaches

Measures used include but not limited to:
individual-level measures such as centrality, homophily, and betweenness, as well as group measures such as density, transitivity, and clustering. This will allow us to scale up to measures at the level of the entire network. We will extend these processes to explore how networks are formed, how information cascades through a network, how networks influence economic decisions, and how networks predict human and organizational behavior. 

With these tools in hand, those projects let us import, build, manipulate, visualize, analyze network data and use these network models to make predictions and conclusions about the social and economic world.
