This project analyze the investor network not at the level of the firm, but at the level of the individual. 
In an ideal world, investors would select entrepreneurs to invest in based on the merits of their quality and the business model of their startups. In reality, however, investors often choose to invest in for other reasons, such as past relationship history, connections to mutual investors or entrepreneurs, or homophily based on personal attributes like gender, ethnicity, and geographic location. This homophily can contribute to a culture of “failing fast”, in which startup founders can become serial founders as a result of being selected not on their prior performance, but on shared personal or network attributes with investors that might choose to invest in their startups. Failing fast has been described as a way for entrepreneurs to learn more about what makes a successful business model, but does this process actually make their companies more successful? The individual-level investor-entrepreneur network and the performance of these companies may provide some explanations.
