This project analyzes electoral data from each Lok Sabha—the lower house of Parliament in India—election from 1951 until 1999. The electoral data is paired with meteorological data that details each district’s monthly level of rainfall. 
The occurrence of extreme weather events in a district is used as a proxy for economic disruption. 

Questions to answer:
whether abnormal levels of rainfall during the time leading up to an election cause more political parties to enter into a district during that election.
whether there is a diffusion process of political parties entering into districts.
