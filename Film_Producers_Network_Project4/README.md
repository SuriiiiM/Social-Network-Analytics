This project analyzes production companies of feature films and the films that they make. Filmmakers are in the fascinating position in which—unlike some other kinds of firms—they must constantly release novel, creative products that are ﬁnely tuned into uncertain and ever-changing audience demand. Many organizations struggle to adapt to changing environments and demand, and struggle to remain competitive—consider the position of a firm IBM today, as opposed to twenty years ago. Yet,the same film production companies that were dominant decades ago remain some of the most dominant today. How are they able to adapt so effectively to new film making technologies and audience interests? The Network of collaboration in film making may explain some of the reasons.

We use film key words and collaboration types to define a company category
i. Peripheral solo productions: films made by a single specialist 
ii. Central solo productions: films made by a single generalist 
iii. Central co-productions: films made by a group of multiple generalists 
iv. Peripheral co-productions: films made by a group of multiple specialists 
v. Hybrid co-productions: films made by a group of generalists and specialists 

Benefit/Cost from collaborations are measured by financial return and creativity gained afterwards
